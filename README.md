# Discord Voice Patcher
- Developed by cypher at https://www.youtube.com/@cypher2226 or discord wcypher
- This tool was created by extensive analysis of discords voice node to force stereo to enable itself even though its disabled in the core without javascript access
- The actual patcher was made in 5 minutes however the reversing took a couple weeks

## Usage
- Run the tool when you launch discord and it will automatically patch your discord process
- This tool is intended for people who want to make their discord stereo and increase base volume of discord to remove any limits of the volume (program does that by default)

## Can this be made permanet?
- Yes and if you are smart you would already know that just by looking at the source code
- No guides on doing this if ur brain work you can do it yourself

## Compiling
- Go into Visual Studio and create a console application, copy all of the source in the discordpatcher.cpp file and override the default .cpp file's contents
- Set the project to release
