# Discord Voice Patcher
- Developed by cypher at https://www.youtube.com/@cypher2226 or discord wcypher
- This tool was created by extensive analysis of discords voice node to force stereo to enable itself even though its disabled in the core without javascript access
- The actual patcher was made in 5 minutes however the reversing took a couple weeks

## Usage
- Run the tool when you launch discord and it will automatically patch your discord process

## Can this be made permanet
- Yes and if you are smart you would already know that just by looking at the source code
- No guides on doing this if ur brain work you can do it yourself
